# Notes
### Enhancements for Production Grade code
1. Logger utility for better logging and debugging.
2. Currently, the project uses sqlite db for demo purposes. Use a persistent DB like Postgres DB or Mongo DB based on future scale and functional requirements. 
3. Use tools like Vault to store application secrets.
4. Explore simpler ways of authentications using a simple service token if possible.
5. Add more tests, use tools like tox, nose to improve coverage and enhance testing experience.
6. Improve the rule_handler code to introduce possible design patterns.
7. Fix the Todos mentioned to adhere to standard coding practices for easy scaling of code.
